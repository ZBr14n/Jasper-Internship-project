## Update (3/12/21):
## All data in this app is demo data to work with and is used for testing purposes only. This app is only a rough draft of what it could be.
### I converted this project to standard react app which was originally from wordpress shortcode. Some functionalities no longer work due to missing dependencies that relied on wordpress, but most of app still works:

### **Update: ** Please see the other part of the project that includes a questionairre survey before this information gets processed to the search directory:
https://github.com/ZBr14n/Jasper-Internship-project/tree/jasper-survey/medical-survey-jasper/app/src


#### For this internship project, I was assigned to create a medical survey that will take answers from patients and populate this information into the search directory, which will show all available dental offices based on location/zipcode, medical conditions, doctor's name. For each entry that is populated, the user is able to click into the modal popup that will populate for that specific doctor. The popuop will display all doctor's information including their ratings and reviews as well as letting the user book an appoinment with the doctor.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
